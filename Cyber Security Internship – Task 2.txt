     Task 2 ‚Äì Analyze a Phishing Email


Objective : 

To analyze a phishing email and identify red flags such as spoofed addresses, suspicious links, urgent language, poor grammar, and social engineering tactics. This improves awareness and helps defend against phishing attacks.



Steps I Followed to Complete the Task

   Step 1: Understood Task Requirements
Read the Task 2 instructions from the PDF provided in the internship.
Understood that I needed to analyze a **phishing email** sample.


Step 2: Found or Created a Phishing Email Sample
I used a "realistic-looking fake phishing email" for educational analysis:

From: security-update@microsoft-secure.com
To: your_email@example.com
Subject: Urgent Action Required: Password Reset

Dear User,

We have detected unusual activity in your Microsoft account. For your security, please reset your password immediately using the link below:

üîó https://m1crosoft-reset-password-login.security-alerts.com

Failure to act in the next 24 hours will result in account suspension.

Regards,
Microsoft Security Team


Step 3: Identified Red Flags in the Email

     Indicator                              Description 
 
 1. Spoofed sender     :   The domain `microsoft-secure.com` looks legit but is "not" Microsoft's official domain. 
 2. Suspicious link    :   Link text says Microsoft, but the URL is: `m1crosoft-reset-password-login.security-alerts.com` ‚Äî clearly fake. 
 3. Urgency language   :   Threatens account suspension in "24 hours" to create "panic" and force the user to act.
 4. Poor grammar       :   Unnatural phrasing like ‚ÄúFailure to act...‚Äù 
 5. Social engineering :   Pretends to be from a trusted brand (Microsoft) to "trick the user" into clicking and submitting login details. 



 Step 4: Used Tools to Analyze (Optional)


 Manually Inspected Sender & Links
I carefully looked at the sender's email address and the link inside the message.

 Example:

The email said it's from: security-update@microsoft-secure.com

But official Microsoft emails come from: @microsoft.com

I noticed:

The sender looks suspicious.
The domain name is fake or lookalike (social engineering trick).
also hovered over the link in the email (without clicking it!) to see the real destination URL:
It pointed to something like:
https://m1crosoft-reset-password-login.security-alerts.com
(This is not Microsoft ‚Äî it‚Äôs a phishing site!)

(Optional) Explored Tools Like:

üîó MXToolbox Email Header Analyzer
This tool lets you paste the full header of an email to check:
Who actually sent the email
If it passed SPF, DKIM, and DMARC security checks
Server IP addresses
Sending domain mismatches

 These checks help spot email spoofing and fake origins.

Gmail ‚ÄúShow Original‚Äù Feature

If you open a suspicious email in Gmail:

Click three dots (‚ãÆ) in the top-right corner of the email
Choose ‚ÄúShow Original‚Äù
This will open a new tab showing the raw email header.

I can:
See the real ‚ÄúReturn-Path‚Äù
Spot IP addresses
Check if SPF and DKIM passed
 
These steps help identify if the email really came from who it claims to.

What I Learned in This Step:

Real attackers spoof email addresses and use tricky links.
Header tools give you clues about the true sender.
You don't need to be an expert ‚Äî just observing carefully can expose a phishing attack!
